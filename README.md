# Home-1 is now index.html
Images broken on the index page because you didnt provide me such images
Mobile field input reqiures a plugin but I didn't implement it.

# Features
-Form inputs are required by Jquery with no validation. 
         If there is no empty field, user will be taken to Home-3

Home-2
Home-2 is now home-3 because home-2 was the initial design and home-3 showed the modal. 
So if I designed the modal on the same page then it becomes one page thereby I named it Home-3

Home-3
Home-3 contains business categories that needs to be selected with a modal pop.
Featres- I'm using jquery to check if any of the categories were selected.
        When the user clicks on any of the categories, it will b selected and the 
        with a green box next it will pop up the modal provided the user selected the item.

Home-4
The initial design you gave me wasn't like what you gave me for Home-2 and 3.
The design was with the modal only, so I made an initial design for that page that 
contains the modal. 
The cards on the page contains this statement "Some content goes here".
Features - Click on the Skip this step and the modal will pop up.
           When the button see what hubtel offers is clicked you shall be taken to  Home-5

Home-5
Home 5 contains the carousel. You didnt provide me with the photo in the middle of the carousel
so I downloaded one from your site.
Features - If you click on the carousels previous and next buttons you shall be taken to the 
respective carousel item

Generally, if some parts of the page weren't completed then its because I didnt get all the 
assets provided.
